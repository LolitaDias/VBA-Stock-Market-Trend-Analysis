The goal of this project was to identify the overall yearly change for individual stocks, using provided data from several years of stock market activity. Since the baseline data was provided in Microsoft Excel, Visual Basic was used to clean and process the data, as well as calculate the desired outputs. 

## Questions

1. What was the yearly net change in stock price?
2. What was the yearly percent difference in stock price?
3. What was the overall volume of the stock at year's end?
4. Which stock had the greatest yearly percent increase in stock price?
5. Which stock had the greatest yearly percent decrease in stock price?
